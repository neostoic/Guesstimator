Guesstimator is a program that searches the Google Places, Yelp, and Foursquare APIs to create a list of bars in the given location. Then, it combines their ratings as a Bayesian estimate to rank them more accurately. 

##Usage
    Search Radius (meters): 40000
    Lat: 41.59
    Long: -93.61
    Would you like more points? (y/n) n
    Searching lat: 41.59 long: -93.61 ...
    Found 90 total businesses!
##Setup
You'll need to acquire API keys for each of the individual services and add them to api_keys.py.

- [Google Places](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/get-api-key)
- [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/developers/manage_api_keys)
- [Foursquare](https://developer.foursquare.com/)

You'll also need to install rauth for authentication.

`pip install rauth`

##Other Usages
This program could also be used to search restaurants, coffee shops, you name it. You'll need to:

- Update the Foursquare CATEGORY_ID
- Change the type parameter in the Google Search URL
- Modify the term parameter in the Yelp Search URL

Review the API documentation for each service to determine what types are allowed.

If you look at the raw data.csv, you'll notice I removed results that were primarily restaurants and adjusted the rankings based on the number of data sources. For more explanation and a full rundown of how I created this program, check out my blog post here.

##Known Issues
You'll have to create an edge case if two bars somehow happened to have the same address. You should never have more than three data sources in your .csv file. If you do, then two bars with the same address are getting bucketed together.
